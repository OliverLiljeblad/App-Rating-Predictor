# App Rating Predictor
## Overview
###Work in progress

This project predicts app ratings on the Apple App Store using attributes like category, price, size, and descriptions. The goal is to help developers optimize their apps for higher ratings by identifying key factors that influence user satisfaction.

## Key Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes trends in app ratings, prices, and categories.

Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, outliers, and text preprocessing.

Feature Engineering: Creates meaningful features like price categories and text-based features from app descriptions.

Modeling: Predicts app ratings using regression models (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest).

Model Interpretation: Uses SHAP values to explain model predictions.

Deployment: Includes a Streamlit web app for interactive predictions.
